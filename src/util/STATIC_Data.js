  {
    HTML: `<p><strong>Fact 1 - Everybody benefits from good feedback</strong></p>
    <p>Every employee, junior or senior, benefits from getting quality, timely feedback.</p>
    <p>Getting quality, timely feedback from those we trust and respect drives career development.</p>
    <p>Without regular, helpful feedback -- we are working in a vacuum.</p>
    <p>Without regular, helpful feedback -- communication, work quality and relationships suffer.</p>`,
  },
  {
    HTML: `<p><strong>Fact 2 - Good performance management programmes are built on good feedback processes</strong></p>
    <p>Good businesses are built on good teams.</p>
    <p>Communication within a good team is efficient and effective.</p>
    <p>Good communicators know how, when and why to give feedback.</p>
    <p>Good HR Leaders give teams the tools to do feedback in a way that motivates and amplifies.</p>
    <p>Uncertainty is a terrible place for a person to be.</p>
    <p>When feedback is done often and well, nobody is uncertain about their performance.</p>`,
  },
  {
    HTML: `<p><strong>Fact 3 - The more people you have, the more costly a bad feedback process is</strong></p>
    <p>Salaries and bonuses make up 60-80% of P&amp;Ls.</p>
    <p>People are the single biggest investment a company makes.</p>
    <p>The more people you have on the books, the more $ at stake.</p>
    <p>If you spent $1 million on a piece of machinery, you'd monitor and fine-tune it so that it performs as good as possible as often as possible.</p>
    <p>Would you spend $1 million p.a. on people, then leave them be without regular fine-tuning from the team?</p>`,
  },
  {
    HTML: `<p><strong>Fact 4 - The longer you wait to put in place a good feedback process, the more your business suffers</strong></p>
    <p>Without a good feedback process, you accumulate "Management Debt"</p>
    <p>Management Debt is like Technical Debt: The longer you leave it, the nastier the clean-up will be.</p>
    <p>But unlike Technical Debt, Management Debt affects&nbsp;everyone, not just developers.</p>
    <p>And a bad relationship is harder to fix than a bad piece of code.</p>
    <p>When Management Debt gets too high, good employees wonder why they're not getting recognised and developed.</p>
    <p>Good, emotionally intelligent employees wonder why their culture isn't people first.</p>`,
  },
  {
    HTML: `<p><strong>Fact 5 - Some employees will leave you soon because they're no longer engaged</strong></p>
    <p>Regardless of your Management Debt, around 13% of employees resign voluntarily every year.</p>
    <p>Why do they leave?</p>
    <p>Remuneration aside, it's because:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>They're not getting the career development they need</li>
    <li>They're not getting recognised for their work</li>
    <li>They don't get along well with their manager</li>
    </ol>`,
